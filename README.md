This code is a Python script that implements a URL shortener using SQLite for database storage. Let's break down the code and understand each part:

Import Statements:

import sqlite3: This imports the SQLite module, which provides an interface to the SQLite database.
import string: This imports the string module, which contains a collection of string constants and utility functions.
import random: This imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers and selecting random elements from sequences.
Function Definitions:

generate_short_code(length=6): This function generates a random alphanumeric code of a specified length (default is 6 characters) using lowercase and uppercase letters and digits.
create_database(): This function creates a SQLite database file named url_shortener.db if it doesn't exist and creates a table named urls with columns id, original_url, and short_code.
shorten_url(original_url): This function takes an original URL as input, checks if it already exists in the database, generates a unique short code if it doesn't exist, stores the original URL and short code in the database, and returns the short code.
get_original_url(short_code): This function takes a short code as input, retrieves the original URL associated with that short code from the database, and returns it.
Example Usage:

The script runs the create_database() function to ensure that the database and table are created.
It prompts the user to enter a URL to shorten, then calls the shorten_url() function to obtain the short code and prints the shortened URL.
It prompts the user to enter a short code, then calls the get_original_url() function to retrieve the original URL associated with that short code and prints it. If the short code is not found in the database, it prints "URL not found".
This script demonstrates a simple implementation of a URL shortener using SQLite for database storage. It allows users to shorten URLs and retrieve the original URLs using the generated short codes. However, this implementation lacks error handling and security features, which would be essential in a real-world application.
