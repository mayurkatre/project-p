This code is a Python script that implements a URL shortener using SQLite for database storage. Let's break down the code and understand each part:

Import Statements:

import sqlite3: This imports the SQLite module, which provides an interface to the SQLite database.
import string: This imports the string module, which contains a collection of string constants and utility functions.
import random: This imports the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers and selecting random elements from sequences.
Function Definitions:

generate_short_code(length=6): This function generates a random alphanumeric code of a specified length (default is 6 characters) using lowercase and uppercase letters and digits.
create_database(): This function creates a SQLite database file named url_shortener.db if it doesn't exist and creates a table named urls with columns id, original_url, and short_code.
shorten_url(original_url): This function takes an original URL as input, checks if it already exists in the database, generates a unique short code if it doesn't exist, stores the original URL and short code in the database, and returns the short code.
get_original_url(short_code): This function takes a short code as input, retrieves the original URL associated with that short code from the database, and returns it.
Example Usage:

The script runs the create_database() function to ensure that the database and table are created.
It prompts the user to enter a URL to shorten, then calls the shorten_url() function to obtain the short code and prints the shortened URL.
It prompts the user to enter a short code, then calls the get_original_url() function to retrieve the original URL associated with that short code and prints it. If the short code is not found in the database, it prints "URL not found".
This script demonstrates a simple implementation of a URL shortener using SQLite for database storage. It allows users to shorten URLs and retrieve the original URLs using the generated short codes. However, this implementation lacks error handling and security features, which would be essential in a real-world application.
another one code that you can use or implement-Imports and Initialization:
The code starts by importing necessary modules from Flask and Python's standard library.
An instance of the Flask application is created.
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template_string, request, redirect
import sqlite3
import string
import random

app = Flask(__name__)
Helper Functions:
generate_short_code(): This function generates a random alphanumeric code for shortening the URL.
create_database(): This function initializes the SQLite database and creates a table to store URLs and their corresponding short codes.
shorten_url(): This function takes the original URL as input, generates a short code for it (if not already present), and stores it in the database.
get_original_url(): This function retrieves the original URL from the database using the short code.
python
Copy code
def generate_short_code(length=6):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))

def create_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('url_shortener.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS urls
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, original_url TEXT, short_code TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def shorten_url(original_url):
    # Code omitted for brevity

def get_original_url(short_code):
    # Code omitted for brevity
Routing:
@app.route('/'): This decorator specifies the URL route for the index page. It renders the HTML form where users can input the URL they want to shorten.
@app.route('/shorten', methods=['POST']): This decorator specifies the URL route for the URL shortening functionality. It handles the form submission and returns the shortened URL.
@app.route('/<short_code>'): This decorator specifies the URL route for accessing the shortened URLs. It redirects users to the original URL corresponding to the provided short code.
python
Copy code
@app.route('/')
def index():
    # Code omitted for brevity

@app.route('/shorten', methods=['POST'])
def shorten():
    # Code omitted for brevity

@app.route('/<short_code>')
def redirect_to_original(short_code):
    # Code omitted for brevity
HTML and CSS:
The HTML and CSS code is included as multi-line strings directly within the Python code.
The HTML code defines the structure of the web pages, including the form for inputting URLs and the page for displaying the shortened URL.
The CSS code defines the styling for various elements of the web pages, such as fonts, colors, margins, and padding.
python
Copy code
# HTML and CSS code included as multi-line strings
Main Execution:
create_database() function is called to ensure that the SQLite database and necessary tables are created before running the Flask application.
The Flask application is run in debug mode, allowing for easier debugging during development.
python
Copy code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_database()
    app.run(debug=True)
This code implements a basic URL shortener web application using Flask, SQLite for database storage, and inline HTML/CSS for the frontend. It provides a simple interface for users to input URLs and obtain shortened versions, as well as redirects users to the original URLs when they access the shortened ones.
